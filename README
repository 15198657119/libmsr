Welcome to libmsr, a friendly (well, friendlier) interface to several of the
model-specific registers in Intel processors.  

INSTALLATION:

mkdir ./lib
cd src
make


Notes:

This software depends on the files /dev/cpu/*/msr being present with r/w
permissions.  Recent kernels require additional capabilities.  We have found it
easier to use our own msr-safe kernel module, but running as root (or going
through the bother of additing the capabilities to the binaries) are other
options.

Call msr_init() before using any of the APIs.

Sample code and API documentation will be forthcoming.  Please feel free to
contact the authors with questions and suggestions.
