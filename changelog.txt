v0.2.1 Uniform
+ made storage function names more consistent
	+ thermal: old function names still work
	+ csr_imc: old function names do not work
+ changed struct names in csr_imc
+ changed data output function names in csr_imc
+ added missing function prototypes for global counters to csr_imc.h
+ Broadwell supported (mostly)
+ Updated pdf documenation
- Removed NUMCTRS from csr_imc.c
+ Added IMC_NUMCTRS to master.h

v0.2.0 Auto
+ added new build system
	+ must be installed with included install.sh
	+ supports Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell
+ added autoconf.c header file generator

v0.1.18 CSR
+ added PCI configuration register (CSR) support
	+ (note that this currently requires CSR-SAFE)
	+ (also only supports Intel CSRs)
+ added iMC performance counters
	+ MC0 Channel 0-3 perf counters
	+ MC1 Channel 0-3 perf counters
+ added Cbo (caching agent) performance counters
	+ C#MSR_PMON_CTL#
	+ C#_MSR_PMON_CTR#
	+ C#_MSR_PMON_BOX_FILTER
	+ C#_MSR_PMON_BOX_FILTER1
	+ C#_MSR_PMON_BOX_CTL
+ fixed problem in RAPL architecture detection

v0.1.17 Request
+ will attempt to work even without whitelist (subject to change)
+ detects the kernel's core layout decisions at runtime
+ added MSRs
	+ 0x3f8 - 0x3FE // in msr_misc.c
	+ 0x60D // in msr_misc.c
	+ 0xC30 - 0xC33 // in msr_counters.c
	+ 0xC36 - 0xC39 // in msr_counters.c
	+ 0x19D // in msr_thermal.c
+ will get energy readings if energy_status registers exist rather
than power_limit 
+ power unit fixed for DRAM on Haswell

v0.1.16 Mission
- Removed deprecated variable from cpuid.c
+ cpuid.c get_core_conf function has been reworked to be more portable
- Removed extraneous code in msr_rapl.c
+ msr_core devidx function now works with even-odd cpu ordering schemes
+ msr_init now stats msr_whitelist
+ libmsr_test now has an message saying if libmsr is working (WIP)
+ libmsr_test now explicitly resets power values to defaults

v0.1.15 Batch
+ Added msrmod command line utility
- Removed msr 0x63B from architecture 06_3C
+ updated msr_rapl to use the latest batch interface, details below
	+ read_rapl_data no longer takes any arguments
	+ read_rapl_data now uses the new batch interface
	+ rapl_data struct has been changed, see msr_rapl.h for details
	+ delta_rapl_data no longer takes arguments 
	+ poll_rapl_data no longer takes arguments
	+ dump_rapl_data arguments have changed, now only takes a FILE *
