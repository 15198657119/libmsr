v0.0 alpha
This tool is in alpha and has not been fully tested. Additionally, updates will
be sparse.

To install, modify the LIBMSR_LIB and LIBMSR_INC variables in the Makefile so
that the path links to libmsr.so (only tested on v0.1.14 and newer) and 
to the location of the libmsr header files, respectively.
